# Drupi
Welcome to the Drupi's github!

**Drupi** is a plugin that allows anyone to customize their Minecraft server using simple scripts written in JavaScript. The possibilities for what you can do with Drupi are near limitless. You could create a simple command, or create a complex minigame easily using Drupi! If you already know how to use JavaScript, you'll be able to enjoy using Drupi right away! If you're new to JavaScript, you may want to visit our wiki https://github.com/drupijs/Drupi-JS/wiki/Getting-Started for some help with getting started!

# Introduction
To write a Drupi script it will be a good idea to learn the basics of javascript. Drupi is relying on functions to register, listen and interact with bukkit. We have some examples on our GitHub page that you can find here https://github.com/drupijs/Drupi-JS/wiki/Getting-Started
